                        Peter Parker became Spider-Man when a special spider bit him during a science show. This wasn’t just any spider—<br/>it had been changed by science and gave Peter superpowers! After the bite, he could climb walls, jump really high,<br/> and sense danger like a real spider. That’s how he turned into Spider-Man! 🕸️🕷️

                    <h4>Spider-Man has some amazing powers that make him a super cool superhero! After being bitten by a special spider,<br/> Peter Parker gained the ability to stick to walls and ceilings, just like a real spider. He also became super strong and<br/> super fast, able to jump high and move quickly to dodge danger. One of his coolest powers is his <em>“spider-sense,”</em><br/> which gives him a tingly feeling when something bad is about to happen.
Besides those powers, Spider-Man can<br/> shoot webs from his wrists using gadgets he built himself. He uses these webs to swing between buildings, catch<br/> bad guys, and save people in trouble. All of these powers help him protect his city and make him <em>one of the most<br/> loved superheroes around!</em> 🕸️🕷️
